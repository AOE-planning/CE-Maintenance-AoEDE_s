# CE-Maintenance-AoEDE_s
This is a minor maintenance update to the work done by Recifense for AOE 1 Definition Edition for the November 10, 2023 AOE DE build v97381.

Update changes entry point earlier in script so assert() on line 94 doesn't fail.

Note: Added requirement to use CE 7.4+ this is easy to remove.
